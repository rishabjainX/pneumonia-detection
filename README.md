Explainable AI Deep Learning Model To Detect Pneumonia in X-Ray Images

Liu's Group @ ASDRP

Model is still in developing stages. Currently a small dataset of x-ray images is being used, accuracy is not optimal. Explainable AI is still being implemented.
Repository will be updated when major changes are made.
